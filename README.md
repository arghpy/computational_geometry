# Computationl Geometry Project

This project is a small implementation for computing convex layers. It was developed as part of a university course on the subject Computational Geometry.

## Contents

The project includes the following:

- Implementation of an application in which the user can draw points by clicking and a series of buttons, one of which computes and displays the convex layers formed around the points and the other which resets everything

- Project documentation in the form of a LaTeX file and a .pdf file

- Presentation in the form of a PowerPoint file


## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Python version 3.10

## Running

Simply run **`final_project.py`** as any other program:

```
$: python3 final\_project.py
```

## Credits

This project was developed by _Andrei Suba_ and _Silaghi-Fartan Stefan_ as part of the Computational Geometry course at West University of Timisoara.
